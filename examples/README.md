# Examples

Runnable end-to-end examples. Each one is self-contained, prints a short
header describing what it does, runs in under a minute on a laptop CPU,
and reports numbers you can sanity-check against the docstring.

The application set covers the most-cited HDC/VSA tasks in the recent
literature; see Kleyko, Rachkovskij, Osipov & Rahimi (2023), *A Survey
on HDC aka VSA, Part II: Applications, Cognitive Models, and Challenges*,
ACM Computing Surveys 55(9): Article 175 ([arXiv:2112.15424](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15424)),
for the broader landscape.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -e ".[examples]"   # core + matplotlib + scikit-learn
python examples/pvsa_quickstart.py
```

## Get started

| Example | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| [`pvsa_quickstart.py`](pvsa_quickstart.py) | 90-second tour through every PVSA primitive: construct `GaussianHV`, bind / bundle with closed-form moment propagation, expected similarity, similarity variance, `BayesianCentroidClassifier`, conformal coverage. |
| [`basic_operations.py`](basic_operations.py) | Binding, bundling, permutation, similarity across MAP / BSC / HRR. |
| [`fhrr_demo.py`](fhrr_demo.py) | Complex unit-phasor hypervectors with position-role permutation, binding, bundling, conjugate unbinding, and similarity-based sequence retrieval. |
| [`classification_simple.py`](classification_simple.py) | End-to-end pipeline with `RandomEncoder` + `CentroidClassifier`. |

## Applications

| Example | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| [`emg_gesture_recognition.py`](emg_gesture_recognition.py) | 8-channel sEMG hand-gesture classification: RMS-per-channel → discretise → channel-value binding + bundle → `BayesianCentroidClassifier` with calibrated probabilities and per-gesture posterior variance. Synthetic data; the same pipeline runs on real data via `bayes_hdc.datasets.load_emg()`. |
| [`activity_recognition.py`](activity_recognition.py) | UCIHAR-style 6-class daily-living activity recognition (walking, stairs up/down, sitting, standing, laying) with feature-value binding, temperature calibration, conformal sets at α = 0.1, and selective-abstention reporting. Pass `--real-data` to load the real UCIHAR benchmark. |
| [`image_classification.py`](image_classification.py) | Classical HDC for vision — random-projection encoding + `CentroidClassifier` (one-shot bundling), `AdaptiveHDC` (5-epoch refinement), and `RegularizedLSClassifier` (closed-form ridge) compared on the same encoded hypervectors. Bundled 8×8 digits offline; pass `--real-data` to load real MNIST 28×28. |
| [`language_identification.py`](language_identification.py) | Character-trigram language ID on 5 European languages with temperature calibration and conformal prediction sets. Long unambiguous sentences collapse to singletons; short ambiguous ones expand. |
| [`sequence_memory.py`](sequence_memory.py) | Position-addressable sequence memory: encode a 12-token sentence as one HV, retrieve each token by un-permuting + cleanup, confidence from top-1/top-2 gap. |
| [`weight_space_posterior.py`](weight_space_posterior.py) | A `BayesianCentroidClassifier`'s weights as a `GaussianHV` posterior. Sample from it, predict with each draw, read off epistemic uncertainty, and verify the posterior commutes with the cyclic-shift action. |
| [`song_matching.py`](song_matching.py) | Bag-of-words song similarity. The sum of word hypervectors is legible by eye; cosine similarity recovers theme pairs and the overlap of shared words is visible on every match. |
| [`kanerva_example.py`](kanerva_example.py) | "Dollar of Mexico" — role-filler binding and analogical reasoning, in BSC (XOR is self-inverse, the algebra is exact, the analogy decodes cleanly). |
| [`eeg_seizure_detection.py`](eeg_seizure_detection.py) | iEEG seizure detection — log-RMS-per-channel + ordinal levels + channel-value binding + bundle + `BayesianCentroidClassifier` + conformal sets. Reproduces the Burrello-Schindler-Benini-Rahimi 2018-2021 pipeline structure on synthetic 8-channel EEG. |
| [`gayler_levy_analogy.py`](gayler_levy_analogy.py) | Pelillo-style graph-isomorphism analogical mapping using Gayler & Levy (2009) holistic vector intersection. Recovers the canonical `A→P, B→Q, C→R, D→S` correspondence on a 4-cycle pair via replicator iteration with Sinkhorn projection. |
| [`resonator_factorisation.py`](resonator_factorisation.py) | Multi-restart MCMC factorisation of a composite hypervector via `bayes_hdc.probabilistic_resonator`. Recovers the index triple of three random factors from a 3-codebook bind, with alignment-vs-iteration trajectory. |
